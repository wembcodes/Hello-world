# Hello-world
Beginning web developer
I am a stay at home mom working on learning sklls that will help me re-enter the work place within 12 to 24 months when my youngest child starts school. The ideal situation is to be able to do web development from home to be able to home school my now 11 year old. I am very excited about being a Udacity Google scholarship recipient!
